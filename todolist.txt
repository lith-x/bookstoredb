    Dev:
        ✔ Get a live-reload dev environment
            Typescript, SCSS, Babel, Webpack
            Unsure about React integration.
    HTML:
        ☐ Figure out how things will be arranged
    Design:
        ✔ Get SCSS
    Scripting:
        ☐ React?
            Pros - makes development a lot easier, dynamic
            Cons - possibly increases load time, request loading, or something else idk
            ☐ Find out impact of react on request time, load times, etc.
            ☐ Find out impact of having react as an *external dependency*
    Data:
        ✔ Info arrangement
            ./data/sampledb.json
        ✔ GQL API or static?
            Data size shouldn't be a concern. The aim is to minimize server requests.
            Going with *static* for now. If one massive request proves difficult,
            dynamic loading with GQL is always an option that can be implemented later.
